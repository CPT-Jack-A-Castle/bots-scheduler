## Introduction

Bots Scheduler is a scheduling system based on [Nextdoor Scheduler](https://github.com/Nextdoor/ndscheduler) that uses jobs templated upon [PyBots](https://github.com/dhondta/pybots). It especially focuses on tasks derived from security-related Web services like Shodan or Censys.


### NdScheduler variations

This project implements a launcher for the [NdScheduler](https://github.com/Nextdoor/ndscheduler) server relying on [Tinyscript](https://github.com/dhondta/tinyscript) that uses a virtual environment. It also provides an alternate version of the Web User Interface for enhancing reports and their flexibility.
